# Describe
LCD_1 :Count the number of times the SW1 button is pressed using a 16x2 LCD to display
LCD_2 :Run the word "FETEL" on the LCD in such a way that it hits the edge and bounces back
LCD_3 :Let the LCD display the count up from 0000 to 9999
ADC_1 :Write a program that if the temperature is greater than 32, LED0 flashes off with a cycle of 500 ms, LCD displays "Alert". If the temperature is less than 32, LED0 turns off, LCD displays "Normal"
ADC_2 :Find the photoresistance value and display it on LCD
ADC_3 :Use a variable resistor to control LED0 flashing speed. If the resistor drops to the lowest level, LED0 flashes with a cycle of 1,000s, if the level is highest, it flashes with a cycle of 5,096s.
Timer_counter :Program the seconds counter to display on the LCD. Press button SW1 to start the clock, press SW2 to stop the clock
Timer_PWM_1 :Color control programming for RGB LEDs
Timer_PWM_2 :Control the brightness of RGB LEDs. Press SW1, the PWM pulse of the current color increases by 5 units, press SW2, it will decrease by 5 units with the initial PWM pulse generated from the Timer with a resolution of 255 units.
